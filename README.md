Different files used to create mock spectra catalogs with CIGALE on the COSMOS field. the notebook File_to_CIGALE-format.ipynb contains the procedure to get a sample of objects from the COSMOS2015 catalog and correct the photometric data. Also the FMOS-COSMOS spectroscopic data. In general it can be use to convert the COSMOS2015 catalog and obtain larger samples without matching to a spectroscopic catalog. 

Notes on the gas-phase metallicity, ionization parameter and reshfit subdivision of the sample to be fitted with CIGALE are also explained. This is important when modeling continuum and emission lines. Modeling continuum-only is easier as the nebular module does not need to be taken into account. The sub-division in metallicity bins after SED fitting the sample and obtaining SFR and stellar mass is straightforward.
